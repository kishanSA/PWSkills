    "In statistics, level of measurement, also known as scale of measurement is a classification that relates the values that are assigned to variables with each other. In other words, level of measurement is used to describe information within the values.

    "It is important to understand the level of measurement of variables in research, because the level of measurement determines the type of statistical analysis that can be conducted, and, therefore, the type of conclusions that can be drawn from the research. When gathering data for analysis, you might notice that the information varies in degree of complexity from past analyses. You can describe the varying degree of complexity using levels of measurement, which help you categorize data by how you can analyze it. Learning about the four levels of measurement allows statisticians and analysts to more efficiently plan for research and present their findings.\n",

A vertical line goes through the box at the median.
