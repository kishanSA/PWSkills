    "Flask has different decorators to handle http requests. Http protocol is the basis for data communication in the World Wide Web.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GET:**\t\n",
    "The most common method. A GET message is send to web server from user's browser, and the server returns back data in the response of that request. The response data can be in HTML, XML, JSON, or in other form formats.\n",
    "This method is less secure, because the requested data is visible in browser's address bar of URL and can be bookmarked or shared.\n",
    " \n",
    "**POST:**\t\n",
    "This request method is used to send data to the server. The submitted data in form or any other format, can be then process on web server. The data received by the POST method is not cached by the server. You can create/modify any data send by this method.The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request."

    "In the client-server architecture, the request object contains all the data that is sent from the client to the server. The Request, in Flask, is an object that contains all the data sent from the Client to Server. This data can be received using the GET or POST Methods. POST is used when your application expects user input to be received by command or an HTTP request, while GET gets all the information before it even has a chance for submission.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "`Form:` It is the dictionary object which contains the key-value pair of form parameters and their values.\n",
    "\n",
    "`args:` It is parsed from the URL. It is the part of the URL which is specified in the URL after question mark (?).\n",
    "\n",
    "`Cookies:` It is the dictionary object containing cookie names and the values. It is saved at the client-side to track the user session.\n",
    "\n",
    "`files:` It contains the data related to the uploaded file.\n",
    "\n",
    "`method:` It is the current request method (get or post).\n"
