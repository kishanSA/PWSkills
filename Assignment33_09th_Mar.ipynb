    "The **normal distribution** is an important concept in statistics and probability theory because it is a versatile distribution that can be used to model a wide variety of phenomena in the real world. Some of the reasons why the normal distribution is so important are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Central limit theorem:** The normal distribution is a key component of the central limit theorem (CLT), which states that the sum of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the underlying distribution of the individual variables. This property makes the normal distribution an important tool for modeling many natural and social phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Statistical inference:** Many statistical tests and inference procedures, such as hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation, rely on assumptions about the distribution of the underlying population. The normal distribution is often used as a default assumption when the true distribution is unknown, due to its mathematical tractability and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Real-world applications:** The normal distribution is used to model a wide range of real-world phenomena in many fields, including finance, engineering, biology, and psychology. Understanding the properties and characteristics of the normal distribution is therefore essential for many practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some real-life examples of normal distributions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heights and weights of a population:** The heights and weights of a population are often approximately normally distributed, with a bell-shaped curve around the mean. This can be useful for understanding typical heights and weights, as well as the degree of variation within the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IQ scores:** IQ scores are often assumed to be normally distributed, with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. This can be useful for understanding the distribution of intelligence in a population and for comparing individuals or groups.\n",

    "**Stock prices:** Changes in stock prices are often modeled as normally distributed random variables, with a mean and standard deviation that reflect the underlying trends and volatility of the market. This can be useful for predicting future prices and managing risk in investment portfolios.\n",

The key difference between the Bernoulli distribution and the binomial distribution is that the Bernoulli distribution is used to model a single trial, whereas the binomial distribution is used to model multiple trials.\n",
