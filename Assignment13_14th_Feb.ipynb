    "**Advantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading in Python offers many advantages that make it a good choice and a widely popular approach. Here are the two main advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multithreading in Python streamlines the efficient utilization of resources as the threads share the same memory and data space.\n",
    "* It also allows the concurrent appearance of multiple tasks and reduces the response time. This improves the performance.\n",
    "* More responsive\n",
    "* Effective use of Multiprocessor architecture due to parallelism\n",
    "* Threads (since part of the same process) communicate with each other more easily than if they were separate processes\n",
    "* They do not require much memory overhead\n",
    "* Multi-threaded servers and interactive GUIs use multithreading exclusively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dis Advantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Increased Complexity** − Multithreaded processes are quite complicated. Coding for these can only be handled by expert programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Complications due to Concurrency** − It is difficult to handle concurrency in multithreaded processes. This may lead to complications and future problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Difficult to Identify Errors**− Identification and correction of errors is much more difficult in multithreaded processes as compared to single threaded processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Testing Complications**− Testing is a complicated process in multithreaded programs as compared to single threaded programs. This is because defects can be timing related and not easy to identify.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Unpredictable results**− Multithreaded programs can sometimes lead to unpredictable results as they are essentially multiple parts of a program that are running at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Complications for Porting Existing Code**− A lot of testing is required for porting existing code in multithreading. Static variables need to be removed and any code or function calls that are not thread safe need to be replaced."
