    "#### Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computing, a database is an organized collection of structured data/information stored and accessed electronically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL**\n",
    "- SQL database or relational database is a collection of highly structured tables, wherein each row reflects a data entity, and every column defines a specific information field. \n",
    "- Relational databases are built using the structured query language (SQL) to create, store, update, and retrieve data.\n",
    "- SQL is the underlying programming language for all relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server,and Sybase, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NoSQL**\n",
    "- NoSQL databases store data in a document format instead of tables. \n",
    "- NoSQL databases store non-structured data such as photos, videos, articles, and more in a single document. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below are a few of the key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database Structure:** \n",
    "Unlike relational databases with tables to store information, NoSQL databases employ a key-value-pairs approach to store all data in one place. In this case, the key indicates a unique element, for example, an email address for employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flexibility:**\n",
    "NoSQL databases can store vast amounts of unstructured data without constraints on the types of data users want to keep together. Flexibility in storing different new types of data as per the varying needs makes NoSQL databases more intuitive and broadens the scope of application. However, databases require extra processing effort and more storage than relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consistency:**\n",
    "Ensuring data availability and data consistency are critical aspects to ensure exceptional database performance. \n",
    "While relational databases always ensure consistent data across SQL database server instances, some NoSQL databases, such as Redis, respond to a query with information that may be incorrect by a few seconds."

    "#### Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DDL** or Data Definition Language is a set of SQL commands used to create, modify, and delete database structures but not data. These commands are normally not used by a general user, who should be accessing the database via an application.\n",
