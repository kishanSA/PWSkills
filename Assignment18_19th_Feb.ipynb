    "#### Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "Flask is a web framework. This means flask provides you with tools, libraries and technologies that allow you to build a web application. This web application can be some web pages, a blog, a wiki or go as big as a web-based calendar application or a commercial website.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>*Advantages of using Flask:*</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalable**\n",
    "Today, applications are often running in containers or using cloud computing with auto-scaling. Applications do not typically \"scale\" themselves. The infrastructure scales. With a smaller application, it's easier to deploy instances across thousands of server easily to handle increased traffic/load. That’s part of the reason why Pinterest needed to migrate from Django to Flask as they grew to support more of a microservices pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simpler Development**\n",
    "If you understand Python well, then you'll be able to move around and contribute to a Flask application pretty easily. It's less opinionated so fewer standards to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flexibility**\n",
    "There are very few parts of Flask that cannot be easily and safely altered because of its simplicity and minimality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance**\n",
    "You can think about a micro framework being slightly more “low-level” than something like Django. There are fewer levels of abstraction between you and the database, the requests, the cache, etc. So performance is inherently better from the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modularity**\n",
    "Modular code provides a huge number of benefits. With Flask, you have the ability to create multiple Flask applications or servers, distributed across a large network of servers, each with specific purposes. This creates more efficiency, better testability, and better performance."

As a best practice, it is the url_for function that is required to be used, as hard coding the URL in templates and view function of the Flask application tends to utilize more time during modification. If we are using hard coding, and in case we would need to change our URL by inserting another element in the URL, we would have to visit each and every template or form in the code library and make the modifications and will lead to overkill. The url_for function is capable of changing this with just a snap of fingers!"
